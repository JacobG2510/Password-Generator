# Password-Generator
A website dedicated to generating a random password.
in this challange the hmtl and css were given as a foundation so that i could focus on the Javascript for this challange.
I first decieded to create the variables so the function of randomizing a password can work then i made sure that the event listener worked when i clicked generate password after i made sure that it worked and added a clearing out function so it reset when you want another one.
